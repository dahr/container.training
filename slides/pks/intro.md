## A brief introduction

- This course was forked from materials initially written by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials and adapted by [Dave Ahr](mailto:dahr@vmware.com) for PKS & NSX-T

- Over time, [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors) also helped to improve these materials — thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the PKS

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a PKS/NSX-T deployment and familiar with its use.

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to create & access your PKS cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>You can experiment with PKS through one of the Hands-on-Labs (HOL)
